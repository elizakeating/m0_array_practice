### How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- I feel pretty confident. I have experience with the concept of arrays from some very basic level programming knowledge I have, so it is just about learning the specifics to Ruby.
### Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- There is nothing I need, but I might take a couple minutes to just look at the other methods I can call for arrays just so I have a general knowledge of them
### What questions do you have about Arrays?
- Are there any uses of Arrays that aren't an obvious choice? For instance, a list of usernames makes sense to be an Array, but are there other examples that aren't as obvious?
